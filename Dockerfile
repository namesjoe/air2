# THIS DOCKERFILE IS INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE AND DEPLOYMENT.
# NOTE! IT IS ALPHA-QUALITY FOR NOW - WE ARE IN A PROCESS OF TESTING IT
#
#
# This is a multi-segmented image. It actually contains two images:
#
# airflow-build-image  - there all airflow dependencies can be installed (and
#                        built - for those dependencies that require
#                        build essentials). Airflow is installed there with
#                        --user switch so that all the dependencies are
#                        installed to ${HOME}/.local
#
# main                 - this is the actual production image that is much
#                        smaller because it does not contain all the build
#                        essentials. Instead the ${HOME}/.local folder
#                        is copied from the build-image - this way we have
#                        only result of installation and we do not need
#                        all the build essentials. This makes the image
#                        much smaller.
